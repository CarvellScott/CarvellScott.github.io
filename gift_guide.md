# Carvell's Gift Guide

Generally I insist on not getting me gifts because I'm hard to shop for and I get self-conscious over the efforts that people put in to do so. But I was inspired by a Secret Santa event at a previous job of mine where my friends just made a spreadsheet of each others' favorites and used those as hints. It worked out suprisingly well, so ideally this guide could build on that.

To be updated over time as my tastes change

## Notes

- Avoid getting electronics and software, I'm VERY picky about what goes in my computers. Instead consider getting a gift card to the store that has it.
- The single rarest song I've listened to is "Powerplay" by Dreamtale. It was a bonus track on a Japanese-only release of the album "Difference". Good luck finding it.
- When in doubt, Amazon gift cards are always good

## Ungift list

Please don't get me any of these, I have too many, people forget I have them, or they're too much responsibility:

- Anything that plugs into a computer
- Anything living
- Socks
- Hats

- Flashlights
- Mice, keyboards, headsets
