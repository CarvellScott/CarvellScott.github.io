Wow. A little over 4 years and the only things of interest I've put here are a few hidden urls for experiments. Yet a lot has happened in those years.

I lost my job, went on a cruise, got a girlfriend, got a new job, played through the new Pokemon games, and that's before the mayhem introduced by the pandemic.
(There's a series of videos on youtube by Julie Nolke called ["Explaining the Pandemic to my Past Self"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnnEGJCa5G181q9CDnaFeP-eUTUUCtvDq) if someone in the future wonders how crazy it was)

Since the start of the pandemic, I achieved my goal of full-time remote work, grew a beard, lost a friendship to politics, learned I had a half-sibling, tested positive for covid, broke up with aforementioned girlfriend.

I've recently realized that people often ask me "Hey Carvell, long time no see, how are you" and I just gloss over way too much of my life to have a meaningful conversation. I mean yeah, there's details I should hide from the general public, but I kinda feel like I should also take up a journaling habit as a form of therapy. Sometimes we need a wall to scream at, you know?

What really motivated me however, was [a now-hidden tweet](https://twitter.com/manuel_frigerio/status/1629059975418089474) in which user said "Please do not apply to a Senior Dev position if your Github history look like this", and showed a calendar with a single green square among a field of white. You can guess that they got blasted by every competent programmer (just in case those of you reading in the future can't read the replies).

Me? I linked to the first "fake git commit generator" I could find, but then I figured "Hey, what if I just filled my github with only semi-meaningless drivel from mostly blog posts?". It's a silly idea driven by mostly spite, but why the hell not. So here we are. I suppose no one but nerds really read blogs nowadays. That and bots scraping personal info (fun fact: there are some lies in this post to throw them off). For today's response to people asking me "What's up?":

- I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. My sleep paralysis demon kinda resembles [No-Face](https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/No-Face) from Spirited Away, but kind of "noisy" without the mask. Just a big staticy vaguely phallic blob of shadows.
- Pokemon Presents was today. I'm saddened that Scarlet and Violet continue to have basically no post-game.
- I talked to one of my exes for the first time in maybe 3 years. Wished her well. I look back and realize how different I am from the guy she fell in love with. But a lot can happen in three years...
