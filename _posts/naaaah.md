Honestly, the expectation of a consistent stream of content is something we as a society should wean ourselves off of. It creates an unecessary pressure on people to get ideas out for whatever flashy new content to be consumed all for what, a power-distributed abyssmally small chance at internet fame?

That's fucking stupid.

Perhaps something more efficient is just a kind of idea repository. Over the years I've more or less made hundreds of notes scattered across hundreds of text files, the vast majority of which are (and due to embarassment, will remain) unpublished. I have so many drafts that the aggregate of them all might as well be considered a tropical storm. There's probably some good stuff scattered here and there among them, but the thing is that I kinda go back and amend things rather frequently. It doesn't make much sense to assign a date to them, save for maybe stuff where I was analyzing the latest version of a game or something.

In fact, this post doesn't even have the proper date format to it. I'm just gonna yeet it at the blog generator and see what happens. Ready? Here we go!
