I'm making a blog!

Useful content to come later, probably.

EDITS (read: lessons learned) in chronological order:
1. I should probably put my name as the author on my posts.
1. "title" in `_config.yml` obviously controls the blog title.
1. [Jekyll has a pretty good tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), though it's mostly assuming you're the one running the server. I'm just taking advantage of github-pages hosting it for free. ðŸ˜œ ...I wonder if that emoji's gonna show. I wonder if it'll automatically format the numbers in this list.
1. IT DOES ALL OF THAT. AWESOME. Also, if you already assigned a theme, you should copy the contents from the corresponding repository on [GitHub Pages themes](https://github.com/pages-themes) before messing with it.
