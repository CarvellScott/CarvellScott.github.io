# About me

I'm a Software Developer in Test that loves programming, both as a hobby and for work. I mostly work with Python nowadays making memey shenanigans such as [python-intensifies](https://github.com/CarvellScott/python_intensifies) in my spare time and trying to make it look like I'm a professional big-shot programmer like all those other tech blogs out there.
