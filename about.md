# About me

I'm a Software Developer in Test that loves programming, both as a hobby and for work. I mostly work with Python nowadays making memey shenanigans such as [python-intensifies](https://github.com/CarvellScott/python_intensifies) in my spare time and trying to make it look like I'm a professional big-shot programmer like all those other tech blogs out there.

If you'd like to get in contact with me regarding something wrong with the site, it's best to create an issue in [the site's repository](https://github.com/CarvellScott/CarvellScott.github.io/issues).
For all other comments, criticisms, job offers, proclamations of affection, etc, I can be reached at karvell.zcott@gmail.com (if you prove you're not a bot and substitute the appropriate letters to get my actual email. A big hint is in the name of the site's repo. ðŸ˜‰)
